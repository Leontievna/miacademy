# Selenium Tests Project

This project contains automated tests using Selenium and NUnit for testing the website.

The main test class is [here](https://github.com/Leontievna/miacademy/blob/main/Tests/ParentFormTest.cs) 

I implemented CI for the allure-report branch. After each PR or PUSH, it starts a test run and generates a new test report. 

If you want to see a report of the execution, it is available on the allure-report branch.
